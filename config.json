    "about_text" : "My name is Sahil Pawale. I am pursuing B-Tech student at VIT Bhopal's Computer Science Department. I was born and raised in Maharashtra. I like to read historical books. I believe history teaches us a lot about different mistakes and achievements of the past, which can help us make informed decisions in the present and shape a better future. I have experience working with both front-end and back-end development and am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more. I also have experience with popular web frameworks such as Flask. In addition to web development, I have a passion for data analysis and machine learning and have developed several applications that utilise these technologies. I have contributed to several open source projects on Github and am committed to continuing to learn and grow as a developer. My goal is to leverage my skills and expertise to create innovative solutions that solve real-world problems and contribute to the development community.",
